Q.2 What are the Different Types of Selectors in CSS & what are the advantages of them?

Ans: 
Different types of selectors:
Element selectors (selects elements by using tag name)
Class selector (selects elements with defined classes)
Id selector (selects elements with their defined ids)
Universal Selector (denoted by *, selects all the elements in the document)
Attribute Selector (selects elements using their defined attribute)
Pseudo Selectors (::before and ::after lets you add content before or after an element)
Advantages:
The different types of selectors in CSS allow you to be specific while targeting an HTML element. 
By using classes, you donâ€™t have to repeat the styling for every element you want to style.
Classes and Ids make the code easier to read.
