Q.9 What’s the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of some global attributes?

Ans: Tags are the name of an element while an attribute of an element contains some additional information about the element. 
For example, <h1 align=”center”> Hello World! </h1>
	          <img src=”./image.jpg” alt=”image” />
In the above example, <h1> and <img /> are tags and align, src and alt are attributes which contain different information about how the tag should behave, the source of image, etc.
Global Attributes are the attributes which can be used with all tags. Some examples are class, id, style, and title.
